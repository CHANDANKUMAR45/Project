# Project
# Online Shopping & Delivery Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a C++ based console application that simulates an Online Shopping (E-commerce) Store.
It supports both Take-Away and Home Delivery orders using efficient Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- Product listing with prices
- Take-Away order management using AVL Tree
- Home Delivery order management using Linked List
- Fast order search using Order ID
- Shortest delivery path calculation
- Distance-based delivery charge calculation
- Menu-driven user interface

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms Used
- AVL Tree (Take-Away Orders)
- Linked List (Home Delivery Orders)
- Dijkstra Algorithm (Shortest path from warehouse to city)
- Prim’s Algorithm (Minimum distance inside city areas)
- Graphs, Trees, Recursion

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- Concepts: Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Theory
- Tools: STL, Console I/O

## 📊 Use Case
This system can be used to understand how real-world e-commerce platforms manage orders,
optimize delivery routes, and calculate delivery charges efficiently.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler  
2. Run the executable  
3. Follow the on-screen menu options  

## 📌 Learning Outcome
- Practical understanding of AVL Trees and Graph Algorithms
- Real-world application of DSA concepts
- Improved problem-solving and system design skills
